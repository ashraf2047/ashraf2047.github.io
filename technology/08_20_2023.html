       <h3>Introducing Grape</h3>
        <p>
        <br><br>Music creation was once a predominantly technical endeavour, requiring esoteric knowledge to create great art. 

        <br><br>Digital instruments came along and created a layer of abstraction that allowed people to outsource most of that grunt work.

        <br><br>AI is creating a similar transformation in software development. This time, the layer of abstraction will be quicker setup times and coding assistants.

        <br><br>In the next 10-15 years, being able to code will be the equivalent of using Microsoft Office today.

        <br><br>As the general population becomes proficient in programming, the learning process will evolve to be more interactive and engaging.

        <br><br>Currently, coding videos on platforms like YouTube and Twitch are static- it’s impossible to interact with the code while watching. This means that you have to replicate the creator's development environment locally to follow along.  

        <br><br>This is very frustrating and time consuming, especially if no source code is provided , you have to write everything from scratch.

        <br><br>So I’m building <a href="https://www.grape.codes/">Grape</a>, a browser-based coding environment for creating interactive software videos. You can transform videos on Grape into an IDE at any moment with the click of a button and code along directly from your browser.

        <br><br>It comes with a pre-configured online IDE with built-in recording and live streaming functionality, so you spend no time on setup. And you can unleash the power of LLM’s to be more creative.

        <br><br>Grape’s value proposition is the interactive nature of the videos. Creators will have access to static (mp4) versions of Grape videos that can be streamed on other video platforms like YouTube, Twitch, e.t.c.
