       <h3> First Post</h3>
        <p>
        I created this site to think out loud. I will share my thoughts about various topics I'm interested in. 
        The posts will be very informal, unfiltered and unstructured. The site will function as a journal of some sort. It will serve to improve my writing
        and hopefully that will have a cascading effect of improving my thinking and reasoning. My opinions come from lived experiences and genuine curiosity.
        
        <br> <br>As a 24 year old, my outlook on life changes frequently and I'm sure I will look back on some of the things I share with a changed mind. 
        But I can promise to never say what I think not to be true, and to be open to different perspectives.

        <br><br>As this is my first post, I'll give a brief introduction about my self. I was Born in Nigeria and moved to Canada when I was 11. 
        I studied engineering at the University of Waterloo. I moved to the US in July of 2022. I'm currently working on AI at Microsoft.

       <br><br> I'm introverted by nature but not shy. I'm quite goal-oriented, some would describe me as a workaholic. I enjoy working out and playing soccer. 
        I feel as though I've overshared so I'll end the first post here.

       <br><br> It is currently 5:19 am in San Jose, California.
